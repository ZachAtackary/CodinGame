  Things to do based on time:
  it should calc the amount of movements it would take to capture a given square
  then it can devide the number of squares gotten by the number of turns it took
  this will give a much better indicator of the value of the square than current
  ways of doing things

  in order to calculate time, I will want to have a recursive function that goes
  through every different order of the empty squares on the border.  This may
  be easier if the list was a different data type, check things out.

  the number of calculations this will take would be astronomical at the start.
  like, 10 billion. if the square is above a certain size (TBD) assume that it
  will have to trace the entire square anyways instead of doing fancy calcs.

  better yet!  order your list so that it goes around the square in order, that
  way, they are already in the optimal order!  no need to recurse! Depending
  on what is the closest blank will decide where to start in the list.

  Time Travel:
  A good begining use of time travel is try to be super greedy in the beginning,
  and then if someone screws you up, go back in time and make it so they cant.
  another good use is if they get a very large chunk of the map, if that happens
  immediately go back in time and stop it from happening!
